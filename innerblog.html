                    <p class="lead">Being cut off from our own natural self-compassion is one of the greatest
                        impairments we can
                        suffer.” ~Gabor Mate</p>
                    <p>It was late at night, and I couldn’t sleep. I could almost hear the thudding of fear that
                        was
                        exploding in
                        my chest. I tried to identify the singular cause of the fear, but it didn’t feel like
                        there was
                        just one
                        thing.</p>
                    <p>There were so many things.</p>
                    <p>It was the world at large and problems in it; it was how my kid was feeling this morning
                        when
                        they got home
                        from school. It was the rift between my husband and me, feeling so much like I couldn’t
                        reach
                        him to build a
                        connection again. It was work and the state of my health. I was eating too much, always
                        unexercised, ever
                        stressed.</p>
                    <p>And I could feel that night the icy fear that liked to crawl up my spine and fill me with
                        abject
                        horror.</p>
                    <p>I just wanted my life to change in so many ways, so I could rid myself of this fear and
                        be over
                        it already.
                    </p>
                    <p>After this night, and the hundreds of other nights like it where I lay awake unable to
                        sleep,
                        feeling so very
                        bad about my life, I learned something very important.

                    That the fear that existed inside of me
                    was actually
                    very, very old, and it was the same fear that was simply playing on repeat, over all my
                    life.
                    Instead of
                    dealing with the hundreds of things that scared me, I had to go to the source of the fear.
                    </p>
                    <p>Oh, how I hated this fear.</p>
                    <p>The list of things I was terrified about was overwhelming, and it filled me with such
                        deep shame
                        about who I
                        was now—a grown adult with children, a business, and a husband. That I could be someone
                        who was
                        almost afraid
                        of their own shadow repulsed me.</p>
                    <p>When I reflect back and think now about that woman, that poor, terrified woman, looking
                        out at the
                        world and
                        feeling so alone in her fear, I feel so much sadness. Not so much about how scared I
                        was—I
                        understand now why I
                        had so much fear in my body and why it stayed there—but because I felt so much shame for
                        feeling
                        that way.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-12 col-lg-6">
                    <img src="https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2018/12/Mental-health.jpg?impolicy=website&width=770&height=431"

                    <p>It was like a double whammy of emotional pain—fear in itself is a big, hard, tough emotion to
                        experience day
                        in
                        and day out. And it requires compassion and understanding. Adding deep feelings of shame that,
                        somehow, I was
                        wrong to feel like this, made the fear so much harder to handle.</p>
                    <p>I yearn to scoop up that woman and hold her and say, “It’s okay. It’s going to be okay.”</p>
                    <p>What made the difference to that woman lying in perpetual fear and to the woman I am now was that
                        I learned
                        about
                        how emotions actually work. And I learned how to work with emotions so they didn’t stay trapped
                        inside my
                        body,
                        growing ever bigger by the decade, creating a life that kept getting smaller as the fear seemed
                        to have seeped
                        out and tainted so much of it.</p>
                    <p>I no longer have a growing list of things that scare me. In fact, I have an ever-shortening list
                        of things
                        that
                        scare me, as I have learned how to not just work with the emotion of fear in the present, but to
                        release the
                        gigantic weight of the past fear that I had been carrying.</p>
                    <p>I discovered that by acknowledging and embracing my fear, I could gradually dismantle the walls
                        it had built
                        around my heart. It was a slow and often challenging process, but each step brought me closer to
                        a profound
                        sense of inner peace.</p>
                    <p>Over time, I developed a compassionate relationship with my emotions. Instead of judging myself
                        for feeling
                        fear, I learned to treat myself with kindness and understanding. I became my own source of
                        comfort and
                        reassurance.</p>

                    comfort and
                    reassurance.</p>
                <p>As I navigated through the layers of fear, I uncovered the core beliefs and experiences that had
                    shaped my
                    emotional landscape. This self-discovery allowed me to reframe my narrative and choose a
                    different path
                    forward.</p>
                <p>Embracing fear became a transformative journey. It was not about eliminating fear but about
                    befriending it,
                    understanding its messages, and using it as a guide for growth. Fear became a compass directing
                    me toward
                    aspects of myself that needed attention and healing.</p>
                <p>Today, I stand on the other side of fear, grateful for the wisdom it has brought into my life. I
                    no longer see
                    it as an enemy but as a loyal companion on my journey of self-discovery and personal evolution.
                </p>
                <p>May you too find the courage to face your fears, to embrace them with an open heart, and to
                    discover the
                    transformative power they hold.</p>
